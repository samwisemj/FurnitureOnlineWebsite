# FurnitureOnlineWebsite

A demo of an online furniture using jsp and servlets

In a world where webpage development is being dominated by Javscripts and its framewoks, this website was developed using nothing but
the very old Servlet technolgy and java servlet pages (jsp). It is crucial to understand the key concept of servlet to work with any other
web development frameworks.

This project shows a sample implementation of an online furniture selling website, done solely using servlets and MySQL 
database in the backend.
